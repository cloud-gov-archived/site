title: Set org, space, and app limits
---

Org Managers are free to configure your org's [quota](/docs/pricing/quotas) capacity among your spaces and applications as you see fit. This enables Org Managers to limit usage and corresponding costs.

## Org

See more about how to [manage your orgs' quotas](/docs/orgs-spaces/limits).

## Space

Org Managers can [create and modify space quota plans](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/adminguide/quota-plans.html#space) to limit the resources used by spaces. See the CF CLI documentation for [`create-space-quota`](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/create-space-quota.html) to create the quota plan, and create a space with that quota plan using [`create-space`](http://cli.cloudfoundry.org/en-US/cf/create-space.html) (which has the option `[-q SPACE_QUOTA]`).

## App

Space Developers can specify application limits in your [application manifest](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/manifest.html) or as `cf push` command line options.

### Application limit options

`memory: / -m`

- **Default:** `1GB`
- **Minimum:** `Based on the app's usage and runtime requirements`
- **Maximum:** `Based on organization's quota and its provisioned apps`

The application memory limit. This setting has a dual-purpose, as your application compute limit is derived from its memory limit. This relationship is explained in detail [here](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/concepts/container-security.html#cpu).

`disk_quota / -k`

- **Default:** `2GB`
- **Minimum:** `Based on the app's source and dependencies disk size`
- **Maximum:** `7GB`

The maximum amount of disk space available to your app.

`instances: / -i`

- **Default:** `1`
- **Minimum:** `0`
- **Maximum:** `Based on organization's quota and its provisioned apps`

Sets the number of application instances to launch. Each additional instance receives the same memory and disk reservation. An application with a manifest specifying `memory: 256M` and `instances: 4` would reserve 1GB (256M x 4) total.

**Limited:**

The application cannot access more than the specified amount of memory.

### Application limit options: sizing

- The environment default of 512MB `memory:` is sufficient for most applications. Static sites and utility applications such as schedulers or loaders may require less. Use `cf app APPNAME` to check your application's current memory and compute utilization.

```

- Any application which exceeds its memory limit will be automatically restarted. Use `cf events APPNAME` to look for 'out of memory' crashes.
